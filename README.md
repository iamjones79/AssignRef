# AssignRef
A code repository displaying the work I completed while working for AssignRef. Everything in this repo is collaborative in nature and has code
that is used by others.

AssignRef provides a site as a solution to assigning and grading officials in sports leagues where costs and tech are prohibiting.

While working as a Full Stack Software Developer, I worked with SQL stored procedures and tables for the back end, .Net/C# services, controllers, and models for the middle tier, and React.js for the front end.
